""" At any time during execution, there are 3 or 4 nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:

    1. the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names

    2. the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope,
    contains non-local, but also non-global names

    3. the next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names

    4. the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names
